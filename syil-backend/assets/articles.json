   "Article body": "<p>Limited warranty certificate for all SYIL CNC machine tools and accessories.</p>\n<p>NINGBO SYIL CNC MACHINE TOOLS CO., LTD</p>\n<p>Valid from January 1, 2024</p>\n<p>NINGBO SYIL CNC MACHINE TOOLS CO., LTD (“SYIL” or “Manufacturer”) provides a limited warranty on all new milling, turning and grinding machines (collectively, “CNC Machines”) and their components (except as set forth below under \"Warranty Limitations and Exclusions\") (“Components”) sold by SYIL or its authorized distributors as set forth in this Certificate. The warranty set forth in this Certificate is a limited warranty, is the manufacturer's sole warranty, and is subject to the terms and conditions of this Certificate.</p>\n<p><strong>Limited warranty coverage</strong></p>\n<p>Each CNC machine and its components (collectively “SYIL Products”) are warranted by SYIL and its representatives against defects in materials and workmanship. This warranty applies only to the end user of the CNC Machine (a \"Customer\")</p>\n<p>“Customer”). The duration of this limited warranty is TWO YEARS (2). The warranty period begins on the date the CNC Machine is installed at the Customer’s premises if purchased through a local vendor, or within one month of shipment if purchased directly from SYIL.</p>\n<p>Extended warranty is only offered by SYIL representatives in local markets.</p>\n<p><strong>Repair or replacement only</strong></p>\n<p>The manufacturer’s sole liability and the customer’s exclusive remedy under this warranty with respect to any SYIL product shall be limited to repair or replacement of the defective SYIL product at the manufacturer's option.</p>\n<p><strong>Warranty disclaimer</strong></p>\n<p>This warranty is the sole and exclusive warranty of the manufacturer and is in lieu of all other warranties of any kind, express or implied, written or oral, including, but not limited to, any implied warranty of merchantability, any implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, or any other warranty of quality or performance or non-infringement. The manufacturer hereby disclaims and the customer hereby waives all other warranties of any kind.</p>\n<p><strong>Limits and exclusions of the warranty</strong></p>\n<p>Components subject to wear and tear under normal use and over time, including, but not limited to, paint, window coating and condition, light bulbs, gaskets, wipers, seals, chip removal system (e.g. augers, chip chutes), belts, filters, door rollers, tool change fingers, etc., are excluded from this warranty.</p>\n<p>To maintain this warranty, the maintenance procedures specified by the manufacturer must be followed and recorded. This warranty is void if the manufacturer determines that (i) a SYIL product has been improperly handled, misused, abused, neglected, accidentally damaged, improperly installed, improperly maintained, improperly stored, or improperly operated or applied, including the use of improper coolants or other fluids, (ii) a SYIL product has been improperly repaired, or (ii) a SYIL product has been improperly repaired or maintained by the customer, an unauthorized service technician or any other unauthorized person, (iii) the customer or any other person makes or attempts to make modifications to a SYIL product without prior written authorization from the manufacturer, and/or (iv) a SYIL product has been used for non-commercial purposes (e.g., personal or household use). This warranty does not cover damage or defects due to external influences or things beyond the manufacturer's control, including but not limited to theft, vandalism, fire, weather conditions (such as rain, flood, wind, lightning or earthquake) or acts of war or terrorism serviced by Customer, an unauthorized service technician, or other unauthorized person, (iii) Customer or any person makes or attempts to make any modification to any SYIL Product without the prior written authorization of Manufacturer, and/or (iv) any SYIL Product was used for any non-commercial use (such as personal or household use). This warranty does not cover damage or defect due to an external influence or matters beyond the reasonable control of Manufacturer, including, but not limited to, theft, vandalism, fire, weather condition (such as rain, flood, wind, lightning, or earthquake), or acts of war or terrorism.</p>\n<p>Without limiting the generality of the exclusions or limitations described in this certificate, this warranty does not include any warranty that a SYIL product will meet the production specifications or other requirements of any person or that the operation of a SYIL product will be uninterrupted or error-free. The manufacturer assumes no responsibility for the use of any SYIL product by any person, and the manufacturer shall not be liable to any person for any defect in the design, production, operation, performance or otherwise of any SYIL product, except for the repair or replacement thereof as set forth in the warranty above.</p>\n<p><strong>Limitation of liability and compensation</strong></p>\n<p>Manufacturer shall not be liable to Customer or any other person for any compensatory, incidental, consequential, punitive, special or other damages or claims arising out of or relating to any SYIL product, other products or services of Manufacturer or any authorized dealer, service technician or other authorized representative of Manufacturer (collectively, “Authorized Representative\"), or the failure of any part or product manufactured using a SYIL product, even if the manufacturer or authorized representative has been advised of the possibility of such damages, which damages or claims shall include, but not be limited to, loss of profits, loss of data, loss of product, loss of revenue, loss of use, cost of downtime, business goodwill, damage to equipment, premises or other property of any person, and damages that may be caused by a malfunction of a SYIL product. All such damages and claims are denied by the manufacturer and waived by the customer. Manufacturer’s sole liability and Customer’s exclusive remedy for damages and claims of any kind shall be limited to repair or replacement of the defective SYIL product, at Manufacturer's option, as provided in this warranty.</p>\n<p>The customer has accepted the limitations and restrictions set forth in this certificate, including but not limited to the limitation of its right to claim damages, as part of its agreement with the manufacturer or its authorized representative. Customer understands and acknowledges that the price of SYIL products would be higher if the manufacturer had to be responsible for damages and claims beyond the scope of this warranty.</p>\n<p><strong>Entire agreement</strong></p>\n<p>This Certificate supersedes all other oral or written agreements, promises, representations or warranties between the parties or the Manufacturer with respect to the subject matter of this Certificate and contains all agreements and understandings between the parties or the Manufacturer with respect to such subject matter.</p>\n<p>Manufacturer hereby expressly disclaims all other agreements, promises, representations or warranties, oral or written, which are in addition to or inconsistent with the provisions of this Certificate. None of the terms and conditions set forth in this Certificate may be modified or amended except by a written agreement signed by both Manufacturer and Customer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the manufacturer will honour an extended warranty only to the extent that it extends the applicable warranty period.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Transferability</strong></p>\n<p>This warranty is transferable by the original customer to another party if the CNC machine is sold in a private sale prior to the expiration of the warranty period, provided written notice is given to the manufacturer and this warranty is not voided at the time of transfer. The purchaser of this warranty is subject to all the terms and conditions of this certificate.</p>\n<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>\n<p>This warranty is governed by the laws of the People's Republic of China.</p>",

   "Article body": "<p>The following sections provide guidelines for the correct maintenance of SYIL X and T Series machines.</p>\n<p>To prevent hazardous conditions that can result in injury or equipment damage, ensure that the equipment and personnel at your worksite fully satisfy these requirements.</p>\n<p>For some procedures, to be performed, specialist tooling may be required. Contact Technical Support for advice as needed.</p>\n<h3>27.1 Lockout – Tagout</h3>\n<p>Always follow your company lockout tagout procedure in addition to the instruction given here</p>\n<h4>27.1.1 Lockout procedures and indicators</h4>\n<p>The mains isolator switch is designed to be locked out with a padlock when doing the lockout. Use a 5 mm diameter padlock.</p>\n<p>To prevent the possibility of accidental startup and the sudden release of accumulated energy, put the SYIL into lockout before beginning inspection and maintenance work.</p>\n<p>During lockout, post signs to indicate the machine’s service status and prevent unauthorized personnel from accessing its main energy isolation facilities. In addition, paste labels over the closure of the electrical cabinet in such a way that opening it requires breaking or tearing them, thus indicating whether any attempt has been made to activate the equipment during lockout.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Main Isolator Switch</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Main Isolator Switch\" class=\"hs-image-align-center\" height=\"303\" style=\"height: auto; width: 450px;\" src=\"https://content.syil.com/hubfs/image-png-Jan-08-2025-11-52-30-3854-AM.png\" width=\"450\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<h3>27.2 Lubrication</h3>\n<p>It is critical that the machine rolling and sliding elements remain lubricated. Failure of the lubrication system can lead to rapid damage to costly elements such as ballscrews, linear rails and sliders.</p>\n<p>The automatic oiler is set on a timer controlled by the PLC ladder of the controller. Parameters within the service level of the controllers dictate the interval at which the oiler will run and for how long each burst is.</p>\n<p>Always ensure the correct grade of lubricant is used in the automatic lubrication pump as indicated on the sticker above the oiler.</p>\n<p>It is recommended that an ISO 32 grade oil is used rather than any heavier oils.</p>\n<p>The Automatic Tool Changer, lubrication of the two roller runners is key. Use waterproof grease on the bearings and the runners.</p>\n<h3>27.3 Recommended Maintenance</h3>\n<p>The following section may be used as a list of tasks to be completed at the described time interval to ensure the SYIL X5 remains in the best condition through its life.</p>\n<h4>27.3.1 Daily</h4>\n<h4>(a) Prework</h4>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; table-layout: fixed; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 1px solid #99acc2; width: 100%;\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding: 6px; width: 37.2611%; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;\">\n<p><strong>Component/Function/Check</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 6px; width: 62.7389%; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;\">\n<p><strong>Action</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding: 6px; width: 37.2611%; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;\">\n<p>Air line pressure</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 6px; width: 62.7389%; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;\">\n<p>Check if compressed air supply is connected</p>\n<p>With machine on, check the red and green LCD display on the pressure switch (Left side of machine)</p>\n<p>NOTE: Large numbers must be higher than the smaller ones</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding: 6px; width: 37.2611%; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;\">\n<p>Coolant level</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 6px; width: 62.7389%; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;\">\n<p>Check coolant is visible in the sight glass</p>\n<p>Top up until fluid level above half mark of the sight glass</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding: 6px; width: 37.2611%; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;\">\n<p>Auto oiler level</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 6px; width: 62.7389%; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;\">\n<p>Visually check there is sufficient oil in the oiler (side of the machine) and fill if needed</p>\n<p>NOTE: Machine will give warning on the controller if below minimum and not run</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding: 6px; width: 37.2611%; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;\">\n<p>Spindle at temperature</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 6px; width: 62.7389%; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;\">\n<p>Always warm up the spindle using the supplied program.

In the event of a very violent crash, it is possible that the ballscrew to motor coupling may slip resulting in the apparent machine coordinates not corresponding to those set by the factory.</p>\n<p>In this case, it is very important to establish if the machine has lost its absolute positions. The implications are that the machine may hit hard stops on any of the axis travels before the soft limits become active. In the case of the Z axis, the tool change position may be incorrect in space and an result in further errors or damage if not corrected.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Set the home positions of the axes that require resetting. The following instruction describe the required steps to recover the absolute positions of each axis.</p>\n<h4>27.7.1 Siemens SINUMERIK</h4>\n<h4>27.7.2 SYNTEC 22MA - Resetting the home position of the axes</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Press E-stop to avoid unexpected movements of the machine</li>\n<li>Manually set the correct position of the spindle</li>\n<li>Press the <strong>Setting </strong>softkey</li>\n<li>Press the <strong> </strong>softkey</li>\n<li>Press the <strong>Goto </strong>softkey</li>\n<li>Go to row number <strong>2803</strong></li>\n<li>Type in password <strong>520 </strong>and press <strong>↵ </strong>Enter</li>\n<li>Move Z axis up <strong>91 mm </strong>(for example if the current coordinate is -102.3 then move to -102.3+91=-3)<br><br><img alt=\"Setting Z value at row number 2803\" class=\"hs-image-align-center\" height=\"262\" style=\"height: auto; width: 350px;\" src=\"https://content.syil.com/hubfs/image-png-Jan-08-2025-12-51-25-9684-PM.png\" width=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br></li>\n<li>Move Z axis to zero point</li>\n<li>Press →</li>\n<li>Press the <strong>Setting </strong>softkey</li>\n<li>Press the <strong> </strong>softkey</li>\n<li>Type in password 520 and press ↵ Enter</li>\n<li>Press the <strong>Serial Tuning </strong>softkey<br><br><img alt=\"Row 3209\" class=\"hs-image-align-center\" height=\"259\" style=\"height: auto; width: 350px;\" src=\"https://content.syil.com/hubfs/image-png-Jan-08-2025-12-51-11-7894-PM.png\" width=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br></li>\n<li>Press the <strong>Normal Axes </strong>softkey<br><br><img alt=\"Normal Axes\" class=\"hs-image-align-center\" height=\"258\" style=\"height: auto; width: 350px;\" src=\"https://content.syil.com/hubfs/image-png-Jan-08-2025-12-50-59-0770-PM.png\" width=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br></li>\n<li>Press the <strong>Set Abs Home </strong>softkey then switch to home mode<br><br><img alt=\"Set Abs Home\" class=\"hs-image-align-center\" height=\"265\" style=\"height: auto; width: 350px;\" src=\"https://content.syil.com/hubfs/image-png-Jan-08-2025-12-50-45-0973-PM.png\" width=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\"><br><br></li>\n<li>Press the <strong>Set Machine Home </strong>softkey</li>\n</ol>\n<p>NOTE: The limit alarm may activate, when losing the zero point.

A wide range of products exists with differencing properties to suit a wide variety of applications.</p>\n<p>In all cases, the oil must be mixed into the water well for the concentration to be constant throughout the volume of fluid. Good mixing can be achieved using purpose made mixing systems offered by coolant fluid suppliers, or by pouring the required proportions of water and oil into the coolant tank directly.</p>\n<p>In the case where the fluids are mixed inside the coolant tank, the fluids must be stirred while in the tank. Stir by doing these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remove the chip trays and mesh filters from the coolant See <a href=\"#_bookmark122\"><em>Figure below</em></a></li>\n<li>Unscrew and remove the secondary covers of the coolant tank under the chip trays.

This will ensure the bearings are correctly lubricated, the ballscrews and the body of the SYIL X5 are at a nominal temperature. Contact the customer service for more information on the correct warmup procedure.</p>\n<h3>26.6 Spindle Care during Operation</h3>\n<p>For a long life of the spindle, it is the responsibility of the user to ensure they are operating within the recommended parameters. If a premature failure of the spindle occurs, replacement will depend on the outcome of investigation by the spindle manufacturer. Ensure a long life of the spindle by following these indications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new spindle must be allowed to run in</li>\n<li>Do not start heavy machining until the spindle has completed the run-in procedure (See Chapter <a href=\"#_bookmark259\"><em>14</em></a>) and no abnormal or unexpected temperatures, vibration or noise is experienced</li>\n<li>During normal operation, never exceed the speed and torque rating of the spindle</li>\n<li>Follow the cooldown procedure if the spindle cartridge is seen to overheat</li>\n<li>Never allow the spindle cartridge to exceed <strong>20 °C </strong>above ambient temperature</li>\n<li>Never allow the spindle cartridge to exceed <strong>55 °C</strong></li>\n<li>Always use balanced tooling and tool holders</li>\n<li>Always keep the spindle clean and complete a warm-up cycle before operating the machine</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>26.7 Spindle Air Curtain</h3>\n<p>An air curtain system is used to keep the spindle cool and free from debris.</p>\n<p>The air curtain continuously leaks air through the body of the spindle cartridge. Be aware that this will require a significant volume of air to be available to the machine.</p>\n<p>During a tool change additional air is exhausted through the spindle taper to eject any chips or cutting on the tool holder.</p>\n<h3>26.8 Operating the Machine</h3>\n<p>NOTE: These operating instructions have sections that are common between all types of controllers. Where each controller has different procedures, refer to each of the individual controller operating and programming manuals.</p>\n<p>NOTE: For the SYIL X5 to move in a safe manner, the Interlocked door must be closed and locked.</p>\n<h4>26.8.1 Operating modes for controller Siemens 828D</h4>\n<h4>(a) Jog mode (JOG)</h4>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; table-layout: fixed; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 1px solid #99acc2; width: 100%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.6317%; padding: 6px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\"hs-image-align-center\" height=\"57\" style=\"height: auto; width: 56px;\" src=\"https://content.syil.com/hubfs/image-png-Jan-08-2025-10-13-15-1625-AM.png\" width=\"56\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 26.1727%; padding: 6px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;\" colspan=\"2\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jog mode (JOG)</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55.1674%; padding: 6px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;\">\n<p>\"JOG\" mode is used for the following preparatory actions:</p>\n<p>Approach reference point, i.e. the machine axis is referenced</p>\n<p>Preparing a machine for executing a program in automatic mode, i.e. measuring tools, measuring the workpiece and, if necessary, defining the work offsets used in the program</p>\n<p>Traverse axes, e.g. during a program interrupt</p>\n<p>Positioning axes</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>NOTE: The following functions are available in \"JOG\" mode:</p>\n<p>\"REF POINT\"</p>\n<p>\"REPOS\"</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.6317%; padding: 6px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;\">\n<p><br><img class=\"hs-image-align-center\" height=\"57\" style=\"height: auto; width: 57px;\" src=\"https://content.syil.com/hubfs/image-png-Jan-08-2025-10-13-44-1893-AM.png\" width=\"57\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 26.1727%; padding: 6px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;\" colspan=\"2\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Handwheel (HANDWHEEL)</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 55.1674%; padding: 6px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;\">\n<p>Enables the use of the MPG</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.6317%; padding: 6px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;\">\n<p><img class=\"hs-image-align-center\" height=\"57\" style=\"height: auto; width: 57px;\" src=\"https://content.syil.com/hubfs/image-png-Jan-08-2025-10-13-53-4597-AM.png\" width=\"57\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 26.1727%; padding: 6px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;\" colspan=\"2\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Reference point (REF.
